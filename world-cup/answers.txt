Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

It seems that the program itself takes about 0.025s to execute, so low number of simulations provide unstable results and without significant
time gain.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10,000 simulations the price would increase steeply, with little return, as the results seem to stabilize by then.
